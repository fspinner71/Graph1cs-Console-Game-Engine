To run this you need to be on windows and have a 32 bit C/C++ compiler like this one:
https://winlibs.com/#download-release

Download instructions are on the website

It doesn't need to be that compiler, but it needs to have the latest version of the windows.h header file.

CONTROLS:

    Player 1:
        W - UP
        S - DOWN
    
    Player 2:
        UP ARROW - UP
        DOWN ARROW - DOWN
